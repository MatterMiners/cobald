    Composition of pools weighted by their current state

    The aggregation of children's :py:attr:`~.Pool.demand`,
    :py:attr:`~.Pool.utilisation` and :py:attr:`~.Pool.allocation`
    is weighted by each child's ``weight``.
    Children can be weighted by their :py:attr:`~.Pool.supply`,
    :py:attr:`~.Pool.utilisation` or :py:attr:`~.Pool.allocation`.
    Note that weighting the :py:attr:`~.Pool.demand` only applies to
    *distributing* it to children; the composite's :py:attr:`~.Pool.demand`
    is always exactly as set by its controller.

    If the total weight is 0, the following fallback applies:

    * :py:attr:`~.Pool.demand` is applied uniformly, and
    * :py:attr:`~.Pool.utilisation` and :py:attr:`~.Pool.allocation` are assumed
      1 if there are no children, 0 otherwise.

    The latter rule expresses that the total fitness of a Pool is 0 either if the
    fitness of all its children is 0, or there are no children.
